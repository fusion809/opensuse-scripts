This repository contains several shell scripts that I have used to make
my life more convenient on my openSUSE machine. They are presented here mostly for educational purposes.

All the files in this repository with the file extension `.sh` are stored in my `~/Shell` directory. While `.bashrc` is stored in my user directory, `~/`.
