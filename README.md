openSUSE Scripts
==================

This repository contains several shell scripts that I have used to make
my life more convenient on my openSUSE machine. They are presented here mostly for educational purposes. They are licensed under [GNU GPLv3](https://github.com/fusion809/opensuse-scripts/blob/master/LICENSE). All the files in this repository with the file extension `.sh` are stored in my `~/Shell` directory. While `.bashrc` is stored in my user directory, `~/`.

To quickly install this repo on your PC, assuming wget is installed, run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(wget -cqO- https://git.io/vaKlZ)"
```

while if cURL is installed but wget is not, run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -sL https://git.io/vaKlZ)"
```
